=====Installing Jenkins======
To install Jenkins on your Ubuntu system, follow these steps:

=====Install Java.===========

Since Jenkins is a Java application, the first step is to install Java. Update the package index and install the Java 8

$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

=====Add the Jenkins Debian repository.=========

$ wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -

=====The command above should output OK ============

===Add the Jenkins repository to the system==

$sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

======INSTALL JENKINS=========

Once the Jenkins repository is enabled, update the apt package list and install the latest version of Jenkins by typing:

$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install jenkins

==================Jenkins service will automatically start after the installation process is complete. You can verify it by printing the service status:

$systemctl status jenkins

========================================

You should see something similar to this:

● jenkins.service — LSB: Start Jenkins at boot time
Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/jenkins; generated)
Active: active (exited) since Wed 2018–08–22 1308 PDT; 2min 16s ago
 Docs: man:systemd-sysv-generator(8)
 Tasks: 0 (limit: 2319)
CGroup: /system.slice/jenkins.service
================================================================
Adjusting Firewall

If you are installing Jenkins on a remote Ubuntu server that is protected by a firewall you’ll need to open port 8080. Assuming you are using UFW to manage your firewall, you can open the port with the following command:

$sudo ufw enable
$sudo ufw allow 8080
$sudo ufw allow 22


==========http://your_ip_or_domain:8080======


=============Unlock jenkins=====
To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, a password has been written to the log (not sure where to find it?) and this file on the server:

/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

SSH on the jenkins server and change the root password.

Successfully Installed.
